This document contains the CHANGELOGs and TODOs of Vid's "TAJGA FASM Tutorial"
and to "FASM PREPROCESSOR GUIDE". First comes the new CHANGELOG and TODOs -- 
from where Tristano took on republishing and editing the original docs.
At the end of this file I've pasted verbatim copies of the original "changes.log"
and "todo.txt" files that were distributed with the tutorial.

******************************************************************************
These second changelogs takes on from where Vid (the original author) left.
NOTE: General English polishing and typos fixes are not listed; only rewriting
      of whole passages is mentioned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2017-01-26]
 -- Changed link to "FASM PREPROCESSOR GUIDE" to point to newly created reprint
    of that doc ("fasm-preprocessor-guide.html").
 -- Added internal links (Chapters and Sub-Chapters)
[2017-01-24]
 -- First reprint of "TAJGA FASM Tutorial": ported from HTML4 to Markdown, and
    converted to HTML5 via pandoc + custom template.
 -- Some changes made to original text:
    -- English text polished to improve readability.
    -- Some paragraphs rewritten to improve clarity.
    -- Fixed a few code typos/errors.
    -- Added or corrected links to mentioned references.
    -- Styled notes, tips and warnings with CSS Alert Boxes.
    -- Applied highlighter style to key passages.
 -- Code errors/typos fixed:
    -- "6.4. Binary operations instructions" --- In first example, line:
            mov bl,00000001b
       was corrected to:
            mov bl,00001001b
       (text and second example make it clear it was a typo)
    -- "6.5. Testing bits": Code in text didn't match example in paragraph:
            "all bits but third of eight_booleans..."
        fixed: `je` => `jz`
    -- "7.5. Some examples" --- In stepping through code example:
            Start: CF=16, BX=1100101000001011b
        fixed: "Start:  CF = 16" => "Start:  CX = 16" 
 -- Reweritten/Revised passages:
    -- "4.1. Endian encodings" --- opening paragraphs partially rewritten to
       improve clarity and readability.
    -- "6.5. Testing bits": rewritten the paragraph:
            "You often need to test value of some boolean..."
    -- "7.1. Addition and substraction" --- typo in terminology definition:
            "terms: incrementing (adding 1), decrementing (substracting 0)"
       fixed: "(substracting 0)" => " (subtracting 1)" "

            ------------------------
    -- "9.1. Explaination of Fixes", in various "equals rest of line (�X�)"
       the "X" part was wrong (must be due to changes in the example code not
       reflected in its commentary). Amendments done in both examples.
 -- Renamed Chapter Titles:
    -- "0. About this document" => "Introduction"
    -- "FINAL WORDS" => "Closeing Remarks"

-- "7.2. Operator `eqtype`":
   -- Paragraph "The `eqtype` operator isn�t limited to just..." is badly broken.
      I've attempted polishing it here and there, and even by consulting FASM
      documentation I couldn't make out what Vid is trying to point out. This
      must have been a WIP paragraph never completed.
-- "9.2. Using Fixes for Nested Macro Declaration":
   -- Paragraph "Only `#` is a special case, you can fix it..." needs fixing,
      it's extremely unclear.

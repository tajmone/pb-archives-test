In compliance with the GPLv2 license terms, all changes to the original library are listed below. All changes here described were carried out by Tristano Ajmone, and they refer to version `1.2.6` of Chroma, as viewable at:

-   <https://github.com/JohnAlbin/chroma/tree/1.2.6>

… or downloadable from:

-   <https://github.com/JohnAlbin/chroma/archive/1.2.6.zip>

List of changes:

-   For the scope of this project, only those files relating to Chroma’s Sass module were imported, leaving out files and folders not strictly related to the Sass workflow (eg: the Ruby Gem and NPM package files, the documentation, GitHub pages website files, the test suite, etc.). Namely:
    -   All the contents of the [`/sass/` folder](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/chroma/tree/1.2.6/sass) from the original repo were copied here, unchanged;
    -   The original [`README.md`](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/chroma/blob/1.2.6/README.md) file from the repo’s root folder was also copied here (contents unchanged), and renamed as [`README_CHROMA.md`](./README_CHROMA.md);
    -   The [`LICENSE.txt`](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/chroma/blob/1.2.6/LICENSE.txt) file from the repo’s root folder was also copied here (contents unchanged), and renamed as [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE).
-   This `README.md` file (the one you’re reading) was added to state changes.

    -   The original [`README.md`](https://github.com/jptaranto/typey/blob/1.0.3/README.md) file from the repo’s root folder was also copied here (contents unchanged), and renamed as [`README_TYPEY.md`](./README_TYPEY.md);
    -   The [`LICENSE.txt`](https://github.com/jptaranto/typey/blob/1.0.3/LICENSE.txt) file from the repo’s root folder was also copied here (contents unchanged), and renamed as [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE).
-   This `README.md` file (the one you’re reading) was added to state changes.

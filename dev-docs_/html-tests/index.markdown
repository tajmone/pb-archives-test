title:      "HTML Test Pages"
...

This folder (only available in PB Archives Source branch) is for testing the template's HTML elements and their CSS styling.

A special baseline grid is provided (via [Baseliner.js](https://keyes.ie/things/baseliner/)) to check Vertical Rythm.

# Basic Test Pages

"__Basic test__" pages cover the common usage of HTML elements. They are intended to check the look and feel of CSS styling in usual contexts.

# Extended Test Pages

"__Extended test__" pages try to cover all possible tag combinations as well as edge-cases. They are intended to prevent unexpected styling results in complex combination.

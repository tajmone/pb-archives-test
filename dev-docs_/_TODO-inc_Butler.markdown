!Task[ ][PB Proj file issue â€” resolve problem of proj file by:]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  !Task[ ][**a)** creating a proj file template (eg: `_Butler.pbp`) with some XML fields remove to copy and rename (ie: `_Butler.pbp`) and add its name to `.gitignore` so that when the user saves the project it doesn't create a false commit! The problem with this approach is that if I change the proj template file users might not be aware of it!]
  !Task[ ][**b)** create a small PB app that cleans up the project file of all spurious fields, and invoke it before commiting.]

:::::: Warning :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

__DELETE & DEPLOY__: I should create two variants of the deploy command:

- `--deploy` (`-d`) --- builds whole project, then deploys to dest folder.
- `--delete-deploy` (`-D`) --- builds whole project, clean up dest folder, then deploy all contents.

The second variant, which deletes files in dest/deploy folder needs some considerations:

1. It should never delete the `/.git/` folder
2. It should not delete gitignored files (eg: compiled binaries, proj. files, and other files that users might be enjoying)

This means that I'll have to find a way to interact with Git and get a list of ignored files, so that Butler won't delete them.

Butler can't rely on the source folder contents for deciding which files to delete in deploy folder, because renaming/deleting source files would result in deletion misses --- and the whole purpose of the `--delete-deploy` option is to ensure that deleted/renamed source files will not be kept in the deploy folder.

Since Butler --- as a standalone app --- might be used also outside of Git projects, I'll have to add some a "`use-git`" project setting to `butler.ini`, so that non-Git projects will not try to invoke Git for a list of gitignored files.

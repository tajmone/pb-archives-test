Contributing to PureBASIC Archives
==================================

Licenses
========

Before submitting resources to this repo, you must check carefully their
license terms, and include each resource’s license along with it.

No License = No Reuse-Rights
----------------------------

### Your work need a license too…

If you are contributing resources which are your creation, then you
should decide under which license terms to release them. Unless you
provide a license for your contributed work, people won’t be able to
legally benefit from it:

> When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under
> exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that
> specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify
> your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or
> litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright
> holder), “nobody” starts including you.

If you’re not sure how licenses work, and which license would better
serve your intentions, try visiting these links:

-   <http://choosealicense.com>
-   <https://opensource.org/licenses>

If you wish to waive all claims on you work, and release it under the
public domain, consider using the Unlicense:

-   <http://unlicense.org>

Stating that your work is public domain might not suffice, because
“public domain” is not legally binding in all countries. A proper
license, like the Unlicense document, will ensure that your work will be
treated as public domain world-wide.

### Assume others’ work is always copyrighted…

If you want to contribute resources found around the web — code examples
found on forums, code and resources found on other repositories —, then
you must check that the code/resources in question come with a statement
regarding their license terms:

> If you find software that doesn’t have a license, that generally means
> you have no permission from the creators of the software to use,
> modify, or share the software. Although a code host such as GitHub may
> allow you to view and fork the code, this does not imply that you are
> permitted to use, modify, or share the software for any purpose.
>
> <http://choosealicense.com/no-license/#for-users>

Just because someone posted some code on a forum — maybe to exemplify an
answer during a discussion — it doesn’t mean that that code is in the
public domain — it only means the author allowed others to *read* it,
not to use it.

As a general rule: lacking evidence to the contrary, always assume the
work of others is protected by copyright — simply because some source
code is out there in the open it doesn’t mean it’s free and open source.
When unsure, always contact the author and ask.

### If in doubt, provide links instead of code…

Whenever you are unable to ascertain the license terms of any resource,
stay on the safe path and contribute a link to it with a review, instead
of the actual resource.

The goal of PureBASIC Archives is to provide a place where resources can
be *legitimately* and *legaly* accessed and shared. If a resource can be
included in the repository, so much the better; otherwise, a link to
follow will still be a precious resource in itself — sparing users
time-consuming searches around the web.

Using Developement Branches
===========================

For resources requiring long-term work before being ready for inclusion
in `master` branch of the repo, some developement branches have been
created to host different kind of works-in-progress:

-   [`dev-tutorials`](https://github.com/tajmone/purebasic-archives/tree/dev-tutorials)
    – WIP relating to tutorials text and code examples.

The idea is to keep separate the developement of different types of
resources, and at the same time join efforts in the developement of
resources belonging to the same kind.

> NOTE: dev-branches are created as needs arise. Need a new dev-branch
> with a different name and scope? Just [open an
> issue](https://github.com/tajmone/purebasic-archives/issues/new)!

Dev-branches encourage sharing WIP with others and collaboration. No
need to wait that a resource if production-ready before making a pull
request for it: work on dev-branches and make PRs whenever you feel like
sharing with others your current WIP.

Sometimes updating old resources needs quite some work: porting old PB
code to run with latest PB version, updating tutorials and documentation
text, translating, polishing text, ecc., are all time-consuming tasks
which might benefit from others’ collaboration. This is what
dev-branches are for!

Markdown Consistency And Automation
===================================

To preserve consistency across markdown files in the repo — especially
for the README files — you’ll find some useful scripts in the
[`/repo-maintainance-tools/`](./repo-maintainance-tools/) folder.

These scripts will handle auto-generation of a Table Of Content, to be
placed somewhere at the beginning of a MD document. If you peek into the
markdown sources, you’ll notice two HTML comment tags enclosing the TOC:

    <!-- #toc -->
          ...
    <!-- /toc -->

… these hidden tags (invisible in HTML previews) are needed for the
autogeneration of the TOC (which is handled by a Node.js tool called
**gfmtoc**).

Also, these scripts will reformat and cleanup markdown sources (via
**Pandoc**), enforcing the GitHub flavored Markdown (GFM) standard over
markdown syntax variants — apart from providing consistency, this
prevents markdown diffing nightmares when resolving merge conflicts.

So make sure that:

1.  You don’t accidentally remove the TOC-tags;
2.  You don’t use a markdown editor which removes these tags (for
    example, current version of the [**Texts**](http://www.texts.io/)
    editor removes them, but the issue should be soon fixed);
3.  Before making a pull request, you run these scripts on any edited MD
    document, to ensure its TOC is up to date with the contents, and it
    source well formatted.

More info on how the scripts work is found in the
[`/repo-maintainance-tools/`](./repo-maintainance-tools/) folder’s
README file.

> **NOTE**: The current automation-script setting for Pandoc
> reformatting are: from `markdown_github-hard_line_breaks` to
> `markdown_github-hard_line_breaks` — ie: GitHub-Flavored Markdown
> minus hard line breaks extension/behaviour. GFM hard line breaks is a
> feature intended for comments, issues and pull request description,
> not for README files; so I’ve disabled it here.

README Files
============

Each resource main folder should contain a `README.md` document. This
improves preview-navigation of the repo on GitHub.

For consistency, all READMEs should be markdown files named `README.md`
— documents other than READMEs can be in any other GitHub supported
format (Asciidoc, textile, ecc.).

Markdown syntax of READMEs should follow GitHub’s markdown rules — so,
it’s ok to take advantage of GFM features like task-lists,
strikethrough, fenced code syntax highlighting, emoji, ecc.

> **REMEMBER**: You can always use Pandoc to convert from a markdown
> flavor to another.

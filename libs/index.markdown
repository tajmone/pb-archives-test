title:    PureBASIC 3rd Party Libraries
# subtitle: SUBTITLE
...

Libraries (dynamic and static), modules, bindings, wrappers, SDKs, and all kind of third party resources that extend PureBASIC functionality…

For each resource we’ll try to include the PureBASIC version with/for which it was created; this should serve as indicator of compatiblity with current version of PB. Resources might have been updated since their inclusion in this list, follow the links to check for latest version.

Outdated resources (ie: for PureBASIC 4) are kept in the list when no up-to-date alternative is available — in case someone might be willing to update them to current PB version.

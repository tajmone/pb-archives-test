About PCRE
==========

PureBASIC’s «**RegularExpression**» PureLibrary uses the **PCRE** (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library component, an open source implementation of Perl regular expressions. Any PCRE supported RegEx (regular expression) is also supported in PureBASIC.

PCRE License
============

PCRE is released under the [**New BSD License**](PCRE_License) license (aka: “BSD-new”, “New BSD”, “revised BSD”, “BSD-3”, and “3-clause BSD”).

Using PCRE/RegEx in Your Apps
-----------------------------

> **IMPORTANT**: The PCRE license requires that a copyright notice and the license text itself be included in any software that uses the library.

If your PureBASIC software uses the **RegularExpression** library, and you want to distribute it publicly, you must include the [PCRE license file](PCRE_License) with the software – ie: *in addition* to the [`PureBASIC_Applications_Licenses.txt`](../../licenses/PureBASIC_Applications_Licenses.txt) file, which doesn’t contain the *full* copyright notice for PCRE.

Info About PB’s PCRE Lib
========================

PureBASIC documentation doesn’t offer any information about the version of the built-in PCRE library, nor the compiler settings used for building it. Most users can do well without these extra info, but advanced users might be interested in these details.

Knowing the exact library version in use is important for knowing which PCRE package we should look for in order to get the documentation for the right version. Through PCRE API documentation is possible to access advanced fucntionality. For example, the [`Get_PCRE_Info.pb`](Get_PCRE_Info.pb) tool uses advanced PCRE API functions to get info about the library’s build-time options – functions which are not mentioned in PureBASIC’s documentation.

PCRE Version
------------

In the [`Get_PCRE_Version.pb`](Get_PCRE_Version.pb) file (inside this folder) you’ll find this code hack to extract the version number and release date of the PCRE lib used by PureBASIC.

!PureBasicFile(Get_PCRE_Version.pb)

Running it produces the following output in the Debugger:

    8.30 2012-02-04

Which means that PureBASIC 5.10 is using PCRE libary version 8.30, released on February 4th, 2012.

PCRE Build-Time Options
-----------------------

The following Table resumes the technical details of the compiler-options used for building PureBASIC’s built-in PCRE component. It was automatically generated with the [`Get_PCRE_Info.pb`](Get_PCRE_Info.pb) tool found in this folder (by @tajmone).

This is info was obtained under MS __Windows 10__ x64:

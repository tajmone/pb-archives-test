Documentation
-------------

This sections strives to gather documentation matching the version of the Scintilla component used in the latest PureBASIC stable release. This ensures that we are reading the correct documentation for using the Scintilla PureLib component.

The current latest version of Scintilla is 3.7.2 (2016/12/30), the version used by PureBASIC (5.51) is lagging behind Scintilla by 21 releases — with 3 major releases inbetween —, and it’s over 2 years older (954 days); therefore the online Scintilla documentation might contain references to features which are not present in the Scintilla PureLib, or that have changed since.

GoScintilla
-----------

-   [`/GoScintilla/`](./GoScintilla/)

by Stephen Rodriguez (aka [**@srod**](http://www.purebasic.fr/english/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=678) and **nxSoftWare**).

GoScintilla is a small Purebasic source-code utility which wraps a lot of the Scintilla API in order to make it easier to use the Scintilla control within our applications to give our programs source code editing facilities.

It comes with a powerful little lexer which is easily configured to give us syntax styling and/or code folding and/or code-completion and/or call-tips (code-tips) … as appropriate for some programming/scripting language or other.

With a few lines of Purebasic code we can have a fully configured Scintilla control up and running in no time and without the need to code our own lexer.

Icons
-----

-   [`/icons1/`](./icons1/)

Drawn by Iago Rubio, Philippe Lhoste, and Neil Hodgson.

Available sizes: 12x12, 16x16, 24x24, 32x32.

These `*.xpp` icons images were downloaded from [Scintilla website](http://www.scintilla.org/Icons.html) and may be used under the same [license](Scintilla_License) as Scintilla.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap):

> **X PixMap** (**XPM**) is an image file format used by the X Window System \[…\] primarily for creating icon pixmaps, and supports transparent pixels.

The `*.png` and `*.bmp` version of the icons were added by @tajmone via [**ImageMagick**](https://www.imagemagick.org)’s `convert` utility, using the following batch script:

About Scintilla
===============

In PureBASIC for Windows the Scintilla component comes as a shared library (DLL) which has to be distributed with the final application — it’s named `Scintilla.dll` and can be found inside PureBASIC’s `/compilers/` subfolder, usually at this path:

```
C:\Program Files\PureBasic\compilers\Scintilla.dll
```

In PureBASIC for Linux and Mac it comes as a static library that is automatically linked with the final compiled binary application, and no additioanl files need to be distributed with your app.

PB Scintilla Version
--------------------

PureBASIC 5.51 uses Scintilla version 3.4.2 (2014-05-22) — last updated in PureBASIC 5.30 (2014/07/23).

The current latest version of Scintilla is 3.7.2 (2016/12/30):

-   [Scintilla History Page](http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaHistory.html)

From the Scintilla History page you might download the source code package matching the version that ships with PureBASIC, and extract the documentation, lexers examples, headers files, and other useful stuff.

There are no known hacks to display which version of Scintilla component is used by the current PureBASIC release — Scintilla doesn’t offer any function to query for version number, nor any constants are present with such info.

The only way of knowing which version of Scintilla is being used by PureBASIC is from PureBASIC History page (also available ins PB Help):

-   [PureBASIC Documentation: History](http://www.purebasic.com/documentation/mainguide/history.html)

                              BUTLER USAGE NOTES                              
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
MARKDOWN SOURCE FILES :: Butler will convert any "*.markdown" file to HTML
    -- "*.markdown" files are always source files (build but don't deploy) and
       they must be in Pandoc Markdown format.
       -- "_*.markdown" files (ie: name starts with underscore) are excluded
          from building. This is useful for reusable markdown snippets that
          are included in various docs but are not standalone docs (see below).
    -- "*.md" files are GitHub Flavored Markdown files and butler will treat
       them as ordinary files.

    The rationale for this distinction is that the ".md" extension is the most
    commnly used for markdown files found inside projects; so Butler expects
    that files with this extension are part of a subproject documentation.
    Also, this allows using the ".md" extension for developer notes and other
    docs that we don't wish to see converted into an HTML page.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILD/DEPLOY EXCLUSIONS :: Some files and folders will be excluded from the
    build and/or deploy process based on the following criteria:
    -- Files/Folders whose name start with "_" are excluded from building.
    -- Files/Folders whose name end with "_" are excluded from deploying.
    A file/folder whose name starts and ends with "_" will be excluded from both
    building and deploying.
    -- "PBA_DEV_*.md" files will be excluded from deployment as they are assumed
       to be documents reserved to the PureBASIC Archives Source project.
       This is useful to leave some notes in GFM MD regarding the maintainance
       and development of a specific subfolder -- eg:
       -- "PBA_DEV_NOTES.md"
       -- "PBA_DEV_README.md"

You should have understood that, while it is indeed possible to implement Object-Oriented Programming in PureBasic, it require some rigor in coding.
But once this task is dealt with, manipulation of objects becomes extremely simple.

However, while OO-Programming introduces greater flexibility in coding (through the application of object concepts), its structural organization uses lots of methods, which leads to bigger executables and some performance losses.

Nevertheless, I hope that this tutorial has at least allowed you to grasp the underlying mechanisms of the OOP paradigm, and to understand its concepts.
